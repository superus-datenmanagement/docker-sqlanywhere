SQL Anywhere SELinux Policy

This policy has been provided as a guideline.  It was written for the Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 5 targeted modular policy and is sufficient to make SQL 
Anywhere run.  You can change this policy to suit your environment as required.

If you install SQL Anywhere in a user's home directory using the policy that is
included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, this policy has no effect.

Installation (one SQL Anywhere install)
---------------------------------------

Note: All examples are written for Red Hat Entperprise Linux 5.

 1. Install the SELinux policy development package for your system.
        
        # yum install selinux-policy-devel

 2. Copy the Makefile from the SELinunx policy development package to the 
    selinux subdirectory of your SQL Anywhere installation.

        # cp /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile /opt/sqlanywhere11/selinux

 3. Run make from the selinux subdirectory of your SQL Anywhere installation.

        # cd /opt/sqlanywhere11/selinux
        # make

 4. Disable SELinux.

        # setenforce 0

 5. Run the sepolicy tool to install the new module.

        # semodule -i sqlanywhere.pp

 6. Relabel your installation based on the new policy rules.

        # restorecon -R /opt/sqlanywhere11

 7. Re-enable SELinux.

        # setenforce 1


Installation (multiple SQL Anywhere installs)
---------------------------------------------

If you have multiple installations of SQL Anywhere that you must apply this 
policy to, use the steps listed above, with the following exceptions:

 o In step 3, before running make, run:

        # ./buildfc.sh <SQLANYWHERE_DIR> [...]

   passing it the root directory of each SQL Anywhere installation.  This
   overwrites the sqlanywhere.fc file (if it exists) with one that applies to
   all listed installations.

 o Apply step 6 to each installation directory.

If you have any problems with this policy, contact SAP Technical Support or
post to the SQL Anywhere forum http://sqlanywhere-forum.sybase.com
