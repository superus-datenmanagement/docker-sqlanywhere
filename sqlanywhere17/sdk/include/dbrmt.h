//************* SQL Remote message encoding interface *******************
//              =====================================
//
// This is an interface for encoding SQL Remote messages
// When SQL Remote generates a message it is in the form of random looking
// bytes. It is sometimes necessary to transform this message into a format
// more suitable for sending through a communications channel.
// one example would be translating the message bytes into uuencoded text
// for transport on a medium which only supports ascii characters.
// SQL Remote ships with an encoding DLL that does something similar to
// this.
//
// Any code which handles a Text message should assume that it may be corrupt
// and return ENCODE_CORRUPT if it is. It is not necessary that this
// level ensures the message is not corrupt (ie. by including a
// crc in the message) SQL Remote will do corruption detection on the 
// message after this level is done with it.
//
// If the functionality of the existing dll is required in a new dll
// the new dll can load and call the existing dll
