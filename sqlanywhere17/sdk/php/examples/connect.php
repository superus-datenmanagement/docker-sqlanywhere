    # This sample program contains a hard-coded userid and password
    # to connect to the demo database. This is done to simplify the
    # sample program. The use of hard-coded passwords is strongly
    # discouraged in production code.  A best practice for production
    # code would be to prompt the user for the userid and password.

    # Connect using the default user ID and password
